# Trying out Nuxt.js with Contentful

Recently i have been learning **Vue.js** and components was a great thing for reusable code for other projects.

Next step was **Nuxt.js** with **Contenful**.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, check out [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
